# Odin Project
Odin personal IA assistant

This project is what I ever wanted when studying IT, deploy my own IA personal assistant.\
To help to study, run my own personal scripts, do web searches and a lot more!

One day I will implement a Neural Network to Odin, so he can manage my smart home!

## How to install Odin


> On windows (recommended):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

if you want to install on a linux `(not tested yet)` you will need to remove pywin32 \
from requirements.txt file and then run 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run Odin


```
python Odin.py
```

When the program starts just wait few seconds to say `Odin Start`

### Wikipedia module

to perform a wikipedia search, after the IA starts, \
just say it `Wikipedia` and then what you want to search on the internet.
